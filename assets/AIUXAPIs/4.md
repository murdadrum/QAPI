I will now update the Canvas document to showcase **Project #4: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Latency Monitor**.

This version of the dashboard is optimized for performance engineering, featuring a latency correlation heatmap that visualizes how context size impacts response times. It includes a "RAG Flow Simulator" to trace the lifecycle of a query through embedding, vector retrieval, and synthesis, alongside real-time metrics for "Time to First Token" (TTFT) and retrieval overhead.

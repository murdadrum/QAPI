We're shifting focus to the **Accessibility (A11y) API Auditor**. This project is unique because it moves accessibility from a "front-end only" concern to a core data requirement.

I've designed this specialized dashboard to feature a real-time audit engine. You'll see a JSON schema validator in action, a "Screen Reader Preview" that simulates how a screen reader interprets raw API data, and colorful health indicators specifically for accessibility compliance.

### Why this project is a Portfolio "Must-Have":

1. **The "Shift Left" Mentality:** Most developers wait until the UI is built to check accessibility. By auditing the API responses directly, you prove that you understand how to catch bugs earlier in the development lifecycle (saving companies significant time and money).
2. **Interactive Simulator:** The "Screen Reader Simulator" in the UI helps non-technical recruiters or product managers immediately "see" the impact of missing data.
3. **Technical Rigor:** It highlights your ability to write custom JSON schema validators and performance-focused monitoring tools using Node.js.

**I have set up the "Audit Terminal" to simulate a real check of a product endpoint. Click "Start New Audit" to see it run through the validation logic!** Which aspect of this would you like to refine next? We can add a "Code Export" feature that generates the JSON Schema for the user, or move on to Project #3 (The LLM Prompt Injection Tester).

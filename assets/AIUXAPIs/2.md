I will update the Canvas to feature Project #2: API Gateway with "Chaos Engineering" UI.

This project showcases your ability to design resilient systems by providing a dashboard that allows users to actively inject "chaos"—such as artificial latency, 5xx server errors, or rate-limiting—into a live API proxy. It features a Chaos Control panel, real-time "Before vs. After" latency tracking, and a circuit breaker status indicator to demonstrate graceful degradation.

We've now jumped to Project #2: API Gateway Chaos Dashboard. This dashboard allows you to simulate high-stress scenarios that are crucial for QA and Resilience engineering.

Key Highlights for Project #2:
Interactive Fault Injection: Use the configuration panel to switch between injecting high latency or server errors (HTTP 5xx).

Circuit Breaker Logic: The UI simulates a real circuit breaker. When errors are injected, the system "trips" the circuit (turns it to Open) to protect the backend, demonstrating your knowledge of advanced API architectural patterns.

Latency Visualizer: A bar chart shows the impact of the injected chaos over time, from baseline performance to the peak of the fault and the subsequent recovery.

Resilience Logs: The edge proxy trace provides a technical breakdown of how requests are intercepted and manipulated at the gateway level.

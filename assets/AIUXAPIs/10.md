We are now moving on to Project #10: GraphQL "Query Cost" Calculator. This project shifts the focus to API Performance and Security specifically for GraphQL.

Unlike REST, GraphQL allows consumers to define their own data requirements, which can lead to "expensive" or "malicious" deeply nested queries that crash servers. This dashboard showcases a "Query Cost Analyzer" that calculates the complexity of a query before it executes, featuring a live cost-meter, depth-analysis visualization, and a "Malicious Query" guardrail.

Key Highlights for Project #10 (GraphQL Cost Calculator):
Interactive Query Editor: A custom text area where you can edit a GraphQL query. It automatically calculates cost based on nesting depth (simulated exponential growth), which is a real-world pattern used in Apollo Server protection.

Pre-Flight Guardrail: The UI visually changes (Emerald to Rose) if the query exceeds a specific "Complexity" score, showing your ability to build preventive security features.

AST Trace Simulator: The terminal traces how a GraphQL server parses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to determine field weights—a highly technical concept that demonstrates deep API knowledge.

Performance Prediction: Estimates database resolver load and latency based on query structure, showing how API design impacts infrastructure costs.

"Design Tokens QA" Auditor.

This specialized dashboard allows you to scan design systems for inconsistencies, featuring a token browser, an automated violation list with AI-driven remediation suggestions, and a "Before/After" visual preview to demonstrate the impact of fixing design debt.

Key Features of "Design Tokens QA" Auditor:
Automated Design Linting: The "Start Audit" simulation traces a scan of a design system, checking for token drifts and accessibility failures.

AI Remediation Agent: Using an LLM-inspired angle, the dashboard explains why a design violation matters (UX context) and suggests the exact CSS or token code to fix it.

Visual Regression Preview: A "Before/After" toggle allows stakeholders to see the impact of design token changes on actual UI components (like a button's contrast ratio) in real-time.

Token Browser & Health Metrics: High-level metrics like "Design Debt" and "System Health" provide a business-level overview of the design system's quality.

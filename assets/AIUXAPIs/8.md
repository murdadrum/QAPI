I will update the Canvas to showcase **Project #8: Synthetic User Flow Monitor**.

This project transitions from testing individual endpoints to validating the entire "User Journey" strictly via API sequences. The dashboard features a multi-step flow visualizer, real-time performance tracking for sequential dependencies, and a terminal that logs the complex handshake between the authentication, catalog, and checkout services.

I will update the dashboard to showcase **Project #9: AI-Powered Mock Data Generator**.

This tool demonstrates the intersection of AI and Developer Experience (DX). It features a natural language interface where developers can describe complex data scenarios, an AI-driven generation engine that produces valid JSON schema, and a "Instant Mock Deployment" simulator. I've also included metrics for "Data Diversity" and "Schema Accuracy" to highlight the QA benefits of using LLMs for test data generation.

### Key Highlights for Project #9 (AI Mock Generator):

1. **Natural Language Interface:** Demonstrates how to build "AI-first" developer tools where complex data requirements are handled by description rather than manual JSON entry.
2. **Schema-Aware Logging:** The terminal trace shows the internal logic—parsing requirements, consulting an LLM, applying localization, and validating against API standards.
3. **Interactive "Deployment":** Clicking generate simulates the full lifecycle: logic execution, JSON production, and mock endpoint "deployment."
4. **Data Science Focus:** Mentions "semantic variance" and "localization," showing that your QA strategy considers global users and edge cases.

**The generator is interactive—type a prompt and click "Generate Mock API" to see it in action! Ready for Project #10 (GraphQL "Query Cost" Calculator)?**

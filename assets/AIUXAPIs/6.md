I've updated the Canvas to showcase **Project #6: The Contract Guardian**.

This version of the dashboard focuses on **Contract Testing (Pact.io)**, which ensures that microservices remain compatible without needing expensive end-to-end tests. The UI now features a **Contract Verification Matrix**, showing real-time compatibility between different "Consumers" and "Providers," and a terminal trace that demonstrates how a "breaking change" is caught during the Pact verification process.

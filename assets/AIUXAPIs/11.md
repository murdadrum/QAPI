I will update the **Canvas** to showcase **Project #11: "Offline-First" Sync Tester**.

This project demonstrates the architecture required for high-availability web applications. It features a network condition toggle (Online/Offline), a local persistence visualizer showing data stored in IndexedDB, and a sync reconciliation engine that handles conflict resolution when connectivity is restored.

I've updated the dashboard to Project #11. You can now toggle the network status and see how the sync logic behaves when actions are taken in an "Offline" state. This completes the technical demonstration of resilient API consumer architecture.

We have now covered 11 out of 12 projects. Are you ready for the final project, **#1: The "Public-First" Open API Documentation Portal**?

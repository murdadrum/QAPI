I'll update the Canvas to showcase **Project #5: Visual Regression for API-Driven UI**.

This iteration focuses on the intersection of QA and UI, demonstrating how automated pipelines can catch layout breakages caused by unexpected API schema shifts. The dashboard now features a "Visual Diff Viewer" with a comparison slider, regression-specific metrics like "Layout Drift," and a pipeline trace that connects schema changes to visual failures.

### Key Highlights for Project #5 (Visual Regression Bridge):

1. **Visual Diff Viewer:** A custom "Split" component with a slider allows visitors to interactively compare a "Healthy" baseline UI with a "Broken" state caused by an API data change.
2. **Schema Drift Detection:** This project emphasizes that UI bugs often start in the backend. It shows a literal `diff` between expected and actual JSON data.
3. **CI/CD Integration:** The terminal traces a full automation flow: detecting an API change, launching Playwright for snapshots, and using Applitools-style pixel analysis to block a deployment.
4. **UX Focus:** It includes metrics like "Diff Confidence" and "Layout Drift," demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of modern QA standards.

The interactive slider is fully functional—you can "drag" across the comparison view to see the regression in action. Ready to move on to **Project #6 (The Contract Guardian)**?
